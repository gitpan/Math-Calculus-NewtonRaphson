Math/Calculus/NewtonRaphson version 0.01
========================================

This module takes an algebraic expression, parses it and then
uses the Newton Raphson method to solve the it. The Newton
Raphson method relies on the fact that the expression you pass
in evaluates to zero where there is a solution. That is, to
solve:-

x^2 = 5

You would need to pass in:-

x^2 - 5

It understands expressions containing any of the operators +, -,
*, / and ^ (raise to power), bracketed expressions to enable
correct precedence and the functions ln, exp, sin, cos, tan, sec,
cosec, cot, sinh, cosh, tanh, sech, cosech, coth, asin, acos,
atan, asinh, acosh and atanh.
